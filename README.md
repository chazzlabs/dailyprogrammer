# dailyprogrammer

From http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/index:

>Dailyprogrammer is about challenging programmers of all skill level with weekly programming challenges. 3 challenges a week are posted at increasing difficulty. Solutions are peer reviewed and redditors can ask for the community for feedback and comments.

I decided to start using dailyprogrammer as an exercise in learning new languages.  Here you'll find my attempts at the weekly challenges.  Any feedback or comments are certainly appreciated!
